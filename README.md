# Sensory-Transparency

These additions on top of the sensors are extremely simple, which allow them to be deployed in real-time. However, these small additions to the robot make it extremely transparent to the human when the robot is able to hear the human (if the human is speaking too softly into the mic, they won't see lights appear on the head), or if the robot is able to see where they're pointing (if the kinect has lost track of the human skeleton, the human will notice the robot doesn't see where they are pointing since the video does not play).

This was done with Horatio Han in the Humans to Robots Laboratory.
